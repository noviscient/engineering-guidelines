## <a name="link-to-ticket">Link to the ticket in the pull request description</a>

Always include a link to the ticket in the pull request description.

## <a name="dont-request-review-until-tests-passed">Don't request a review until tests have passed</a>

By default, wait for the test suite to pass before asking for a review. One of main purposes of the tests (in particular, the
linting) is to save a reviewer's time by picking up on issues that would otherwise be flagged by a human.

Sometimes unrelated tests '[flake]'. If you think that's what has happened, [rerun the CircleCI workflow from failed] to give them another chance to pass.

The only exceptions to requesting a review with failing tests should be when:

- There are failing tests on the master/main branch that are unrelated to your changes. Try to rebase your branch as soon these
  are fixed, but it doesn't need to block a review.
- You need the reviewer's help to fix the tests or provide early feedback that you're going in the right direction. In this case, make sure the pull request is still in draft, as it isn't
  production ready.

In either case, mention in your pull request description why there are failing tests.

## <a name="ensure-reviewers-have-context">Ensure your reviewers have enough context</a>

Use the pull request description to provide context so others can review it effectively.

Code changes don't usually speak for themselves. Reviewers need to understand the broader context: what are we trying to
achieve? Is there anything you're unsure of? Is there any time sensitivity? And so on.

It is also important to align on the kind of review you are seeking. Do you want feedback on the fundamental approach?
Do you want someone to think, in detail, about correctness? Are you unsure about whether it's safe to deploy? Unless
you're getting a review from a close teammate, it can be difficult for reviewers to know what you're expecting
from them. "Please review this change" is probably not enough context for many pull requests.

## <a name="commit-message-format">Commit message format</a>

Each commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer. The header has a special format that includes a type, a scope and a subject:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The header is mandatory and the scope of the header is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer than 72 characters! This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

### Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert:`, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

### Type

Must be one of the following:

- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation only changes
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- test: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
- revert: Described above

### Scope

The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example `app_strategies`

If more than one scope is affected, use colon to concatenate them. For example `app_strategies, app_products`

### Subject

The subject contains succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize first letter
- no dot (.) at the end

### Footer

List related github issues here. For example `Close #123, Fix #456`

### Example Commit Message

Complete:

```text
refactor(widget): rename key_metric widgets

Rename "Return Attribution" to "Simple Return Attribution", since it is  # 72 characters limit
a simplified version of fama-french returnattribution widget.

Close #123, #456.
```

Simple:

```text
feat: implement fama-french widgets
```

## <a name="do-only-one-thing-with-each-commit">Do only one thing with each commit</a>

Express a single thought with each commit. This can result in very small commits
(e.g. fixing a typo) or quite large ones (e.g. moving many modules to
different package). The point is that a reviewer should be able to hold the commit
in their head without too much trouble.

What constitutes 'a single thought' is a judgement call. You may choose to add
several interdependent Django models in a single commit, as it makes sense to be
reviewed as a single thing: in this case, the data model. You may choose to
use one commit to add type annotations for an entire module, because it is
ultimately driven by one thought. The golden rule is that it should make the life
of the reviewer easier.

If you're writing 'change this and that' in a commit message, it's a strong indication 
that you should break up the commit.

## <a name="clean-up-mistakes">Clean up mistakes by rewriting history</a>

Avoid commits that fix bugs or linting issues introduced in a previous commit. Instead, rebase these
commits to give a clean history before requesting code review for a pull request. Make it look like you did everything
perfectly the first time around.

Note: this doesn't necessarily apply once you've received a review, when you may wish to make changes
[as additional commits](#show-changes-using-additional-commits). However, you should always squash away corrections
before merging to the main branch.

## <a name="dont-mix-refactoring-with-functional-changes">Don't mix refactoring with functional changes in the same commit</a>

It's hard to review commits that contain both refactoring (changes to the way code is expressed) and functional changes. Split them up so refactoring stands on its own.

## <a name="atomic-commits">Make each commit atomic</a>

Before a pull request merges, its commits should be self-contained (a.k.a. "atomic").

This means that after each commit:

- The test suite should pass;
- The codebase could be safely deployed to production.

So don't half-implement a feature in one commit then fix it in a later commit. Structure your pull requests so that each change keeps the codebase in a deployable state.

Tip: if you want to write a failing test and then fix it in a later commit, you can keep the test suite passing by
decorating the test with `pytest.mark.xfail`.

## <a name="dont-surprise-with-urgent-prs">Try not to surprise reviewers with urgent, complex pull requests</a>

If you have a time-sensitive pull request that you are preparing, engage with your intended reviewers ahead of time to
let them know it's coming.

Complex PRs can take a lot of time to review: if you need a fast turnaround, the more notice the better.

## <a name="acknowledge-comments">Acknowledge every review comment</a>

Always respond to every comment to indicate to the reviewer that you‚Äôve seen and thought about what they said. This
doesn't have to be onerous: often a üëç reaction is sufficient.

## <a name="make-clear-what-has-changed-since-last-review">When re-requesting reviews, make it clear what has changed</a>

When re-requesting a review after some requested changes, make it clear to the reviewer what has changed since their
last review. This helps them save time as they may not remember where they reviewed up to last time.

There are a few approaches for doing this:

### <a name="comment-and-rewrite-history">Approach A: comment and then rewrite history</a>

One way to address changes is to amend previous commits.

If you're doing this it can force the reviewer to look back and reread lots of code they have already reviewed, so help
them out by communicating each change with a PR comment.

### <a name="show-changes-using-additional-commits">Approach B: show changes using additional commits</a>

Alternatively, you can make changes by adding commits on top of what you have already done, leaving the original commits
in place. You can, if you like, use [fixup commits] to do this. If you do this, it's helpful also to let the reviewer know which commit to review from.

Additional commits make changes clearer to the reviewer, but it has the downside of a messier commit history which will need to
be tidied up before merge.

Don't forget to squash the corrections together before merging, as per
[Clean up mistakes by rewriting history](#clean-up-mistakes). You can add the _Fixup before merging_ label to your PR to
remind yourself.

### <a name="rewrite-history-but-link-to-diffs">Approach C: rewrite history and link to diffs</a>

You can achieve the best of both worlds by:

1. Creating additional fixup commits, and push them;
2. Link to each fixup commit in PR comments;
3. Squash and push the commits, so they disappear from the history.

The links to now-disappeared fixup commits will continue to work for anyone who wants to check the diff.

### Choosing an approach

Approach C. is a nice option if you're feeling diligent, but it is a bit more effort. More often you'll choose one of
the first two options:

- For small, simple pull requests, Approach A. (rewriting history) tends to work better as it's cleaner, doesn't require much
  rereading of code, and avoids the need for a final clean up before merging.
- For more complex pull requests, many reviewers find Approach B. (additional commits) helpful. But not everyone
  prefers this.

If you're not sure, the best thing to do is ask your reviewer what they would like: the easier it is for them, the
sooner you'll get a review, which is good for you too.

## <a name="only-merge-if-you-have-buy-in">Only merge if you have enough buy-in for the change</a>

One PR approval is not necessarily enough to hit the merge button. You should gain the appropriate level of buy-in for the change.

The more people the change will affect, the more buy-in is needed. For example, if a PR touches code that has a GitHub
'code owner' group, they'll be automatically tagged for review. While an approval from a code owner is not a hard
requirement, you should give someone in the group a chance to respond. If you're not sure, contact the relevant person
or team. Equally, if someone has expressed an interest in what you're working on, it's a sign that they're a stakeholder
who should be given the opportunity to be involved.

For potentially contentious pull requests, it's best to publicize it and wait a few days before merging.
Even this might not always be enough: if the original author of the code is on holiday, you should consider waiting until they return.

Certain pull requests hinge on a matter of preference. If that's the case, consider conducting a poll to gauge what people think.

Sometimes it's hard to know whose buy-in you might need: if that's the case, just ask someone more experienced
to help you identify who to involve.
